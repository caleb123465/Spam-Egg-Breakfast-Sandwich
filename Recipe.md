Recipe:
Add whipping cream and fresh milk to egg and beat lightly till well-mixed.
Heat frying pan (medium low heat) with 1 tbsp of salted butter, when butter starts foaming, pour the egg mixture into the pan. After 10s, use a spatula and quickly stir the egg mixture to scramble it.
Once one side is set, flip the egg and off fire, let residual heat cook the scramble egg.
Cut a slice of luncheon meat about 0.5cm and fry using the same pan (no need to add oil) till golden brown and crispy.
Spread thin layer of butter on one side of each slice of bread. Toast the bread till slightly brown.
Combine the luncheon meat and scramble eggs on the two slices of bread. Cut into triangles and serve hot.
